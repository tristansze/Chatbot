##**Welcome to Bumper!**##

#**Introduction**#

Bumper is an interactive and intelligent platform designed to revolutionize the way students study. With clear goals in mind, Bumper offers a user-friendly experience that enhances academic productivity.

At the heart of our platform is a personalized chatbot named Bumper. He is dedicated to assisting students with their academic queries. Whether you need help with homework, want to understand complex concepts, or require guidance on your study plan, Bumper is there to provide intelligent and responsive support.

In addition to our chatbot, we also allow students to create or join virtual study rooms with their friends. These rooms feature synchronized YouTube video playback, enabling students to watch educational content together in real-time. This collaborative environment not only makes studying more engaging but also fosters a sense of community and support among peers.

With Bumper, studying becomes a more interactive, enjoyable, and productive experience.

#**Implementation**#

Bumper is powered by the OpenAI API, when deployed or while visiting our site, certain features such as chatting with Bumper may not function properly due to disabling of API calls. The backend is powered by NodeJS and the frontend is designed using ReactJS. We utilized WebSockets to allow for connections between clients in shared chatrooms.
